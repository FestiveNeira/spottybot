- make two endpoints. 
    - post/put `save current song to database list`
        - "get current playing spotify song"
        - store some info to database
        - return some output to endpoint response
    - get songs
        - returns json object with all the songs in the db
    - good to get feel for...
        - postgres server
        - spotify api
        - information flow
        - database user schema
- maybe think about
    - linter
    - unit tests

- if unit tests, make run before merge?
